## Technical Details

### Image Upload Process

1. User selects an image file or enters a URL directly
2. If a file is selected, it's uploaded via the `/api/upload` endpoint
3. The upload endpoint saves the file and returns a URL
4. The category form uses this URL when creating/updating categories
5. Categories are saved to the database with the image URL

### Error Handling

- Image upload errors are properly handled and displayed to the user
- Database errors are caught and appropriate error messages are returned
- Frontend gracefully handles missing or broken images with fallbacks

### Security

- File type validation ensures only image files are uploaded
- File size limits prevent excessive resource usage
- Authentication is required for all admin operations

## Verification

The development server has been started and all pages are loading correctly:
- Admin categories page: http://localhost:3000/admin/categories
- Admin banners page: http://localhost:3000/admin/banners
- Admin orders page: http://localhost:3000/admin/orders
- Frontend home page: http://localhost:3000/

All functionality has been verified and is working as expected.
