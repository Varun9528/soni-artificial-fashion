## Overview
This document summarizes all the improvements and fixes implemented for the Soni Artificial Fashion e-commerce platform, addressing all the requirements specified by the client.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/database/server-db.ts` - Ensured proper field mapping in getAllBanners function
- `src/components/BannerSlider.tsx` - Verified image path handling

### 2. React "removeChild" Error Fixed
**Problem**: Admin order page was throwing a React "NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node" error.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated the order detail page to use more stable keys for list items
