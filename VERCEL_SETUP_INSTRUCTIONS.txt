IMMEDIATE DATABASE SETUP FOR VERCEL DEPLOYMENT
==============================================

YOUR WEBSITE: https://www.soniartificalfashion.store
CURRENT ISSUE: No database connection, so products/banners don't show

QUICK SOLUTION (Do this immediately):

1. CREATE A FREE PLANETSCALE DATABASE:
   a. Go to https://planetscale.com/
   b. Sign up with GitHub or email (FREE)
   c. Create database named: soni-artificial-fashion
   d. Click "Connect" button
   e. Select "MySQL" connection method
   f. Save these details:
      - Host: [copy from connection page]
      - Username: [copy from connection page]
      - Password: [copy from connection page]
      - Database: soni-artificial-fashion

2. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN VERCEL:
   Open a new terminal/command prompt and run EACH command:
   
   cd c:\xampp\htdocs\pachmarhi\soni-artificial-fashion
   
   vercel env add DB_HOST
   # When prompted, paste the Host from step 1f
   
   vercel env add DB_USER
   # When prompted, paste the Username from step 1f
   
   vercel env add DB_PASSWORD
   # When prompted, paste the Password from step 1f (will be hidden)
   
   vercel env add DB_NAME
   # When prompted, type: soni-artificial-fashion
   
   vercel env add DB_PORT
   # When prompted, type: 3306

3. VERIFY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   Run: vercel env list
   You should see 5 environment variables listed

4. SEED THE DATABASE (CRITICAL STEP):
   This makes your products appear:
   
   npx prisma db push
   npx prisma db seed

5. REDeploy YOUR APPLICATION:
   vercel --prod --yes

ADMIN CREDENTIALS (Important - Don't lose these):

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If products still don't show:
1. Check: vercel env list (should show 5 variables)
2. Run the database check: node check-db-connection.js
3. Make sure you ran the seeding commands in step 4
