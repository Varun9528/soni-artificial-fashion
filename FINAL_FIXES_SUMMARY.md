# Final Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the issues identified and fixed in the Pachmarhi Tribal Art Marketplace web application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cart Removal Functionality (✅ FIXED)
**Problem**: DELETE requests to `/api/cart` were returning 400 errors when trying to remove items from the cart.

**Root Cause**: 
- Mismatch between how the frontend was sending the productId (as URL parameter) and how the backend API was trying to receive it (from request body)
- Property naming inconsistency in database results (`product_id` vs `productId`)

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated the DELETE endpoint in [/api/cart/route.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/pachmarhi/soni-artificial-fashion/src/app/api/cart/route.ts) to properly extract productId from URL parameters
- Fixed property naming in [server-db.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/pachmarhi/soni-artificial-fashion/src/lib/database/server-db.ts) getCartItems method to return `productId` instead of `product_id`
- Simplified the DELETE endpoint implementation to directly use URL parameters

**Verification**: 
- Created and ran comprehensive tests that confirm cart items can be successfully added and removed
- Verified that the cart functionality works correctly with real database products

### 2. Database Implementation Issues (✅ FIXED)
**Problem**: TypeScript compilation errors due to missing methods in the server database implementation.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added the missing `createOrder` method to [server-db.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/pachmarhi/soni-artificial-fashion/src/lib/database/server-db.ts)
- Ensured all database methods are properly implemented

### 3. Authentication Issues (✅ FIXED)
**Problem**: Authentication was failing in several API endpoints due to missing database initialization.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added `enableRealDatabase()` calls to all API routes that require database access
- Specifically fixed the [/api/orders/route.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/pachmarhi/soni-artificial-fashion/src/app/api/orders/route.ts) endpoint to use real database

### 4. Order Access Permissions (✅ FIXED)
**Problem**: Regular users couldn't access their own orders, only admin users could access the orders API.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Modified the GET endpoint in [/api/orders/route.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/pachmarhi/soni-artificial-fashion/src/app/api/orders/route.ts) to allow regular users to access their own orders
- Added proper permission checks to distinguish between admin and regular user access

### 5. Notification System Enhancement (✅ FIXED)
**Problem**: Notification system was incomplete, missing proper email templates for different order statuses.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added comprehensive email templates in [emailService.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/pachmarhi/soni-artificial-fashion/src/lib/emailService.ts) for all order statuses:
  - Order shipped
  - Order out for delivery
  - Order delivered
- Enhanced the admin order update API ([/api/admin/orders/[id]/route.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/pachmarhi/soni-artificial-fashion/src/app/api/admin/orders/%5Bid%5D/route.ts)) to send appropriate status-specific notifications
- Added notification sending to the order creation API
- Added notification sending to the checkout API
